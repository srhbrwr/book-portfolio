                <p>You’re on a route not familiar to you.</p>
                <p>Cruising through a midwestern state. Nothing but fields as far as you can see. Corn. Beans. Grass. Boring and plain.</p>
                <p>A copy and paste landscape.</p>
                <p>Occasionally little sections of forest pop up. Like a desert oasis. What’s hiding in there you wonder? In the daylight, it looks out of place. By nightfall, you’re still driving. Something happens. Your vehicle quits responding and putters to a stop. You realize you’re stranded. No other traffic on the road. You check your phone, no service out here. Zero bars. It’s getting chilly. Can you wait it out until a car comes? Or do you walk? You look all around. Fields and fields. Except for a stretch of woods along a stream. Have they gotten closer since you got out of the car?</p>
                <p>Trick of the eyes</p>
                <p>Trick of the night</p>
                <p>It’s just boring flyover country</p>
                <p>Without the light</p>

                <p>Mark knocked a second time on the old wood door. Winter was mostly over, but the cold air was still biting his skin. He wasn’t planning to hang around long if they kept him on the patio. Floorboard creaks began to emanate from inside so either someone was coming or the house was groaning back at the late season cold.</p>
                <p>A woman came to the door, probably in her seventies. She peered out of the glass first at Mark and then all around him, checking perhaps to make sure he was the only visitor. Mark smiled, nodded, and greeted her. She returned the gesture, cracked open the door and let shine her Midwestern charm.</p>   
                <p>“Good afternoon, what can I do for you, young man?” She smiled ear to ear. Mark was optimistic.</p>   
                <p>“Hi, thanks. I’m, uh, Mark Maeson. Are you Gemma?”</p>        
                <p>“Yes, that’s me. What can I do for you, Mark?” She pulled the door a little closer, unsure what to think about the fact that Mark knew her name.</p> 
                <p>“I had called and left a message. I got your information from one of your neighbors the, uh, Millsons. They had referred me to your husband Arthur. Is he around?”</p>
                <p>“Ohh, you’re that man. I had forgotten your name already. The Millsons gave me a call about you. I’m sorry I missed your message. Yes, Art is home. Don’t call him Arthur, though, or you’re bound to get less out of him.” She chuckled a bit, opened the door wide, and waved Mark inside.</p>
                <p>“Your shoes look clean enough, Mark. Don’t worry about kicking them off. Can I get you something to drink? Coke? Iced tea?”</p>
                <p>“Some tea would be great actually, thank you.” </p>
                <p>Gemma spun around and moved swiftly around the kitchen. Without pausing she called out for Art, letting her words carry to every corner of the house. A response of creaks and groans came back as the wood floor upstairs shifted under the weight of a moving body. Gemma turned back around with a glass full of iced tea and gestured for Mark to sit at their dinner table. She dropped the tea on a napkin and smiled as she went back to the counter.</p>
                <p>“Gemma. What’s going on? Oh.” Art stepped into the kitchen and for a moment didn’t notice Mark at the table. </p>
                <p>“Hey there, Art right? I’m Mark.” Mark and Art exchanged a firm handshake and Art took a moment to tilt his head back and look down his nose at Mark through his sliding glasses.</p>
                <p>“Hey Mark, nice to you meet ya. Are you the one Jim Millson called about?”</p>
                <p>“One and the same. I really appreciate you giving me some of your time.”</p>
                <p>“No trouble. Now, Jim said you had questions about some land around here? He made it sound like you were chasing ghost stories or something.”</p>
                <p>Mark laughed, “No sir, not ghosts. I dabble in a little bit of everything. History, geography, journalism. I’ve worked for several schools in Iowa, the state government, and most recently the Des Moines Register. I’m doing research for a new book now, and I’m investigating different areas around the state with stories to tell. You know, Iowa has such a rich history, and the more I travel around the state the more interesting I find it.”</p>
                <p>Art had his mouth slightly open and his eyebrows up. He seemed unsure if he still had any idea of what Mark was after.</p>
                <p>“So you’re some kind of half-assed Indiana Jones?”</p>
                <p>Mark grinned. “More like his less handsome younger brother. I spend most of my time in books or dirt and not fighting Nazis.” Mark took a sip of his tea and continued.</p>
                <p>“I came here because of Ducamp’s land.” Mark stopped there, and studied their reactions. Gemma had her back to them but had stopped moving. Art’s mouth had closed, his eyebrows leveled. He was now forming thoughts.</p>
                <p>“The more time I spent in this part of the state, the more that name came up. I really don’t know much yet. I’ve just found the succession of land holders which doesn’t even go back that far to it being open territory. That’s all there is in the official record at least.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, Ducamp’s is interesting.” Art had started, paused, took in a breath and went again. </p>
                <p>“At first I was thinking you were coming here to talk about the Lost 98.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, actually that’s on my list too. That isn’t far from here either, but I just figured I would start chipping away at Ducamp’s if I could. They both seem to have a lot tales attached to them.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah you could say that. It’s strange isn’t it? Both of them being so close in the same area?”</p>
                <p>“Certainly. That’s why I’m here. I’m just trying to collect as much information as I can, even if it’s just stories you know. Oral history is still history.”</p>
                <p>“Well, Ducamp’s is pretty cut and dry to me you know? It’s just a large timber. I know a few stories about it, I think just from guys who hadn’t spent too much time outdoors. I mean I’ve been all around Ducamp’s, and it just looks like normal Iowa woods. Nothing special about it. I’ve even walked through it a few times, no different than a lot of other woods around here. They both have a lot of pine trees in and around them though. Makes it tougher to see in or out. Again, not uncommon here, but there are plenty of woods around without any pine in them at all. Take from that what you will. I take it as people just get nervous about what they can’t see.”</p>
                <p>“Right, so tell me about the owner. He doesn’t allow hunters right?”</p>
                <p>“Oh that guy. Yeah, big city guy from Minnesota. He thought he had found a good land deal. The original owner, Don Ducamp, passed away with no family or heirs. This guy from Minnesota, I’m not even sure of his name to be honest. But he came down and did a walk through the land. He was really into Native American culture and stuff, so I think he thought he was doing some sort of Vision Quest. Well, Ducamp’s is big, but it ain’t no Amazon. Anyways, this guy starts through and comes out and says nobody can come on the land anymore. Ducamp used to let certain hunters he trusted on there, but this guy said that was no longer the case. When pressed, he said the land was sacred. When pressed further, he admitted that while making his way through the property, he had a vision of an Indian with a white buffalo. That was the sign that the land is sacred, and it was not to be disturbed and trampled upon. He went back to Minnesota and has never returned. He contracts a farmer, though, to tend to the bit of farmland around the timber with strict instructions about not disturbing any of the interior. That way, he is at least making some profit off his “sacred” investment.”</p>
                <p>“Wow, yeah that is quite the story. So where did you hear all of this originally? Did you know Don Ducamp well?”</p>
                <p>“Nah, not really. I had met him once or twice, but he was already older than I am now when I met him the first time. After he passed, there was a lot of talk about what was going to happen to the land. As you can guess, we have a pretty close community here. All of our farms are connected some way or another, and all of our farms surround Ducamp’s. Not to mention the handful of guys Ducamp had granted hunting access. So once that purchase had gone through, lots of people tracked that fellow down and pestered him with questions about the land. I think he was just making that bullshit up to try and scare people off. He didn’t want people stomping all over his investment.”</p>
                <p>Mark had pulled a pad and pen out of his jacket, taken another sip of his iced tea and was jotting a few notes.</p>
                <p>“So has anyone else said anything over the years about seeing a Native American or a buffalo out there?”</p>
                <p>“Not that I’m aware of, except the second time I had ever talked to Ducamp. He swore he saw an albino deer looking out of the woods once. Just a regular white tail buck with a typical rack. Now that’s not unheard of. I’ve read about them types of deer popping up before, but that already conflicts with the story of the guy from Minnesota. A giant white buffalo would be kind of hard to hide, even in all those acres of woods. So did he see a buffalo, or just the same deer Ducamp saw? Did he really see an Indian? Or did he just want to see something so bad his mind played tricks on him?”</p>
                <p>Mark was nodding along, making some more notes.</p>
                <p>“I’ve heard that supposedly the Lost 98 has a little bit of mystery as well. Some say one or two people have disappeared around there. Are there stories like that related to Ducamp’s too?” </p>
                <p>Art drew a deep breath.</p>
                <p>“Well, years and years ago, there was a kid who went missing. The whole county went searching for him. It was a big deal I’m sure you could find some information about it. The story goes, his parents split up, and the mom had gone to live with her parents in Omaha. The kid had shown up in town multiple times with injuries, and people were starting to fear the dad was taking the divorce out on him. A lot of people accused the father of just killing the boy, but others said the kid probably just took off to get away from him. So anyways, some people had said they had seen the kid in and around Ducamp’s before all of this happened and figured he had gone to hide out in there. Unlike the Lost 98 where people had legitimate reasons not to go in, they scoured Ducamp’s for days with dozens of volunteers and dogs. They never found anything. Although they were sure they had found some tennis shoe tracks around the edge of the timber, there weren’t enough of them to make a trail or anything.”</p>
                <p>Mark looked up from his notepad. “Yeah, you know somebody else had mentioned that story even before I made my way into the county. I’ll have to check some old newspapers out and see what I can find. I really appreciate you taking some time with me Art, but I don’t want to spoil your weekend here.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, it’s no bother. I’d love to tell you more, but that’s about all I know on Ducamp’s. I know even less about the Lost 98, but I know some other folks who have stories.”</p>
                <p>Gemma cleared her throat. She was giving Art a look now. Mark couldn’t tell what was happening, but it seemed like some sort of signal. Mark tried to cut the air.</p>
                <p>“Well, thank you, for your time and the tea.” </p>
                <p>“Wait.” Gemma said.</p>
                <p>“Come on now, Gemma, I don’t want to be sending him over there.” Art seemed to be reading her mind.</p>
                <p>“Art, the man is writing a book and doing research. Let him make up his own damn mind.”</p>
                <p>“I’m sorry, is there something else?” Mark’s curiosity was peaked. He suddenly thought of Alice. Up until recently it had felt like Mark was maybe just chasing tall tales in search for Iowa’s little known histories. Now it felt like he was starting down his very own rabbit hole.</p>
                <p>“Gemma wants me to tell you to go see Martin Foreth. He has some stories to tell about Ducamp’s, but he is, and always has been, hard on the bottle, so I don’t take much stock in what he has to say.”</p>
                <p>“Ah, well I wouldn’t mind paying him a visit. It couldn’t hurt I suppose. Do you know how to get a hold of him?”</p>
                <p>Gemma responded.</p>
                <p>“I’ve got one of his old cards. He used to have a business, but his address and number on there are still good. Let me go get it.”</p>
                <p>Arthur rolled his eyes, then went into an arm stretch and yawned.</p>
                <p>“So, you think this Martin is just full of it?” Mark asked.</p>
                <p>“Like I said the guy has always been one to drink. He used to do a lot of deer hunting back in the day, and he didn’t do that sober either. The story goes he went into Ducamp’s once with a couple of the guys allowed to hunt in there. Martin disappeared. The hunters came out without him, couldn’t find him anywhere. Called friends down to help, even got a couple of police down there. Nobody could find Martin. Everyone knew he was a drinker, and figured he had either fallen asleep, or had stumbled out of the timber and wandered away. Well, he was gone over a day I think, and people were muttering that Ducamp’s had turned into the Lost 98 and claimed its own soul or whatever they say. Then Martin turns up, laying in one of the cornfields that runs next to the Ducamp timber. He was bloodied, his right leg had been broken but had a splint on it. He said he had fallen, broke it, and blacked out from the pain. When he woke up, he was being dragged out to the corn field.”</p>
                <p>“Dragged? Who was dragging him?”</p>
                <p>“He said it was an Indian.”</p>

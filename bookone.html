                <p>You’re on a route not familiar to you.</p>
                <p>Cruising through a midwestern state. Nothing but fields as far as you can see. Corn. Beans. Grass. Boring and plain.</p>
                <p>A copy and paste landscape.</p>
                <p>Occasionally little sections of forest pop up. Like a desert oasis. What’s hiding in there you wonder? In the daylight, it looks out of place. By nightfall, you’re still driving. Something happens. Your vehicle quits responding and putters to a stop. You realize you’re stranded. No other traffic on the road. You check your phone, no service out here. Zero bars. It’s getting chilly. Can you wait it out until a car comes? Or do you walk? You look all around. Fields and fields. Except for a stretch of woods along a stream. Have they gotten closer since you got out of the car?</p>
                <p>Trick of the eyes</p>
                <p>Trick of the night</p>
                <p>It’s just boring flyover country</p>
                <p>Without the light</p>

                <h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-one">Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>Mark knocked a second time on the old wood door. Winter was mostly over, but the cold air was still biting his skin. He wasn’t planning to hang around long if they kept him on the patio. Floorboard creaks began to emanate from inside so either someone was coming or the house was groaning back at the late season cold.</p>
                <p>A woman came to the door, probably in her seventies. She peered out of the glass first at Mark and then all around him, checking perhaps to make sure he was the only visitor. Mark smiled, nodded, and greeted her. She returned the gesture, cracked open the door and let shine her Midwestern charm.</p>   
                <p>“Good afternoon, what can I do for you, young man?” She smiled ear to ear. Mark was optimistic.</p>   
                <p>“Hi, thanks. I’m, uh, Mark Maeson. Are you Gemma?”</p>        
                <p>“Yes, that’s me. What can I do for you, Mark?” She pulled the door a little closer, unsure what to think about the fact that Mark knew her name.</p> 
                <p>“I had called and left a message. I got your information from one of your neighbors the, uh, Millsons. They had referred me to your husband Arthur. Is he around?”</p>
                <p>“Ohh, you’re that man. I had forgotten your name already. The Millsons gave me a call about you. I’m sorry I missed your message. Yes, Art is home. Don’t call him Arthur, though, or you’re bound to get less out of him.” She chuckled a bit, opened the door wide, and waved Mark inside.</p>
                <p>“Your shoes look clean enough, Mark. Don’t worry about kicking them off. Can I get you something to drink? Coke? Iced tea?”</p>
                <p>“Some tea would be great actually, thank you.” </p>
                <p>Gemma spun around and moved swiftly around the kitchen. Without pausing she called out for Art, letting her words carry to every corner of the house. A response of creaks and groans came back as the wood floor upstairs shifted under the weight of a moving body. Gemma turned back around with a glass full of iced tea and gestured for Mark to sit at their dinner table. She dropped the tea on a napkin and smiled as she went back to the counter.</p>
                <p>“Gemma. What’s going on? Oh.” Art stepped into the kitchen and for a moment didn’t notice Mark at the table. </p>
                <p>“Hey there, Art right? I’m Mark.” Mark and Art exchanged a firm handshake and Art took a moment to tilt his head back and look down his nose at Mark through his sliding glasses.</p>
                <p>“Hey Mark, nice to you meet ya. Are you the one Jim Millson called about?”</p>
                <p>“One and the same. I really appreciate you giving me some of your time.”</p>
                <p>“No trouble. Now, Jim said you had questions about some land around here? He made it sound like you were chasing ghost stories or something.”</p>
                <p>Mark laughed, “No sir, not ghosts. I dabble in a little bit of everything. History, geography, journalism. I’ve worked for several schools in Iowa, the state government, and most recently the Des Moines Register. I’m doing research for a new book now, and I’m investigating different areas around the state with stories to tell. You know, Iowa has such a rich history, and the more I travel around the state the more interesting I find it.”</p>
                <p>Art had his mouth slightly open and his eyebrows up. He seemed unsure if he still had any idea of what Mark was after.</p>
                <p>“So you’re some kind of half-assed Indiana Jones?”</p>
                <p>Mark grinned. “More like his less handsome younger brother. I spend most of my time in books or dirt and not fighting Nazis.” Mark took a sip of his tea and continued.</p>
                <p>“I came here because of Ducamp’s land.” Mark stopped there, and studied their reactions. Gemma had her back to them but had stopped moving. Art’s mouth had closed, his eyebrows leveled. He was now forming thoughts.</p>
                <p>“The more time I spent in this part of the state, the more that name came up. I really don’t know much yet. I’ve just found the succession of land holders which doesn’t even go back that far to it being open territory. That’s all there is in the official record at least.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, Ducamp’s is interesting.” Art had started, paused, took in a breath and went again. </p>
                <p>“At first I was thinking you were coming here to talk about the Lost 98.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, actually that’s on my list too. That isn’t far from here either, but I just figured I would start chipping away at Ducamp’s if I could. They both seem to have a lot tales attached to them.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah you could say that. It’s strange isn’t it? Both of them being so close in the same area?”</p>
                <p>“Certainly. That’s why I’m here. I’m just trying to collect as much information as I can, even if it’s just stories you know. Oral history is still history.”</p>
                <p>“Well, Ducamp’s is pretty cut and dry to me you know? It’s just a large timber. I know a few stories about it, I think just from guys who hadn’t spent too much time outdoors. I mean I’ve been all around Ducamp’s, and it just looks like normal Iowa woods. Nothing special about it. I’ve even walked through it a few times, no different than a lot of other woods around here. They both have a lot of pine trees in and around them though. Makes it tougher to see in or out. Again, not uncommon here, but there are plenty of woods around without any pine in them at all. Take from that what you will. I take it as people just get nervous about what they can’t see.”</p>
                <p>“Right, so tell me about the owner. He doesn’t allow hunters right?”</p>
                <p>“Oh that guy. Yeah, big city guy from Minnesota. He thought he had found a good land deal. The original owner, Don Ducamp, passed away with no family or heirs. This guy from Minnesota, I’m not even sure of his name to be honest. But he came down and did a walk through the land. He was really into Native American culture and stuff, so I think he thought he was doing some sort of Vision Quest. Well, Ducamp’s is big, but it ain’t no Amazon. Anyways, this guy starts through and comes out and says nobody can come on the land anymore. Ducamp used to let certain hunters he trusted on there, but this guy said that was no longer the case. When pressed, he said the land was sacred. When pressed further, he admitted that while making his way through the property, he had a vision of an Indian with a white buffalo. That was the sign that the land is sacred, and it was not to be disturbed and trampled upon. He went back to Minnesota and has never returned. He contracts a farmer, though, to tend to the bit of farmland around the timber with strict instructions about not disturbing any of the interior. That way, he is at least making some profit off his “sacred” investment.”</p>
                <p>“Wow, yeah that is quite the story. So where did you hear all of this originally? Did you know Don Ducamp well?”</p>
                <p>“Nah, not really. I had met him once or twice, but he was already older than I am now when I met him the first time. After he passed, there was a lot of talk about what was going to happen to the land. As you can guess, we have a pretty close community here. All of our farms are connected some way or another, and all of our farms surround Ducamp’s. Not to mention the handful of guys Ducamp had granted hunting access. So once that purchase had gone through, lots of people tracked that fellow down and pestered him with questions about the land. I think he was just making that bullshit up to try and scare people off. He didn’t want people stomping all over his investment.”</p>
                <p>Mark had pulled a pad and pen out of his jacket, taken another sip of his iced tea and was jotting a few notes.</p>
                <p>“So has anyone else said anything over the years about seeing a Native American or a buffalo out there?”</p>
                <p>“Not that I’m aware of, except the second time I had ever talked to Ducamp. He swore he saw an albino deer looking out of the woods once. Just a regular white tail buck with a typical rack. Now that’s not unheard of. I’ve read about them types of deer popping up before, but that already conflicts with the story of the guy from Minnesota. A giant white buffalo would be kind of hard to hide, even in all those acres of woods. So did he see a buffalo, or just the same deer Ducamp saw? Did he really see an Indian? Or did he just want to see something so bad his mind played tricks on him?”</p>
                <p>Mark was nodding along, making some more notes.</p>
                <p>“I’ve heard that supposedly the Lost 98 has a little bit of mystery as well. Some say one or two people have disappeared around there. Are there stories like that related to Ducamp’s too?” </p>
                <p>Art drew a deep breath.</p>
                <p>“Well, years and years ago, there was a kid who went missing. The whole county went searching for him. It was a big deal I’m sure you could find some information about it. The story goes, his parents split up, and the mom had gone to live with her parents in Omaha. The kid had shown up in town multiple times with injuries, and people were starting to fear the dad was taking the divorce out on him. A lot of people accused the father of just killing the boy, but others said the kid probably just took off to get away from him. So anyways, some people had said they had seen the kid in and around Ducamp’s before all of this happened and figured he had gone to hide out in there. Unlike the Lost 98 where people had legitimate reasons not to go in, they scoured Ducamp’s for days with dozens of volunteers and dogs. They never found anything. Although they were sure they had found some tennis shoe tracks around the edge of the timber, there weren’t enough of them to make a trail or anything.”</p>
                <p>Mark looked up from his notepad. “Yeah, you know somebody else had mentioned that story even before I made my way into the county. I’ll have to check some old newspapers out and see what I can find. I really appreciate you taking some time with me Art, but I don’t want to spoil your weekend here.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, it’s no bother. I’d love to tell you more, but that’s about all I know on Ducamp’s. I know even less about the Lost 98, but I know some other folks who have stories.”</p>
                <p>Gemma cleared her throat. She was giving Art a look now. Mark couldn’t tell what was happening, but it seemed like some sort of signal. Mark tried to cut the air.</p>
                <p>“Well, thank you, for your time and the tea.” </p>
                <p>“Wait.” Gemma said.</p>
                <p>“Come on now, Gemma, I don’t want to be sending him over there.” Art seemed to be reading her mind.</p>
                <p>“Art, the man is writing a book and doing research. Let him make up his own damn mind.”</p>
                <p>“I’m sorry, is there something else?” Mark’s curiosity was peaked. He suddenly thought of Alice. Up until recently it had felt like Mark was maybe just chasing tall tales in search for Iowa’s little known histories. Now it felt like he was starting down his very own rabbit hole.</p>
                <p>“Gemma wants me to tell you to go see Martin Foreth. He has some stories to tell about Ducamp’s, but he is, and always has been, hard on the bottle, so I don’t take much stock in what he has to say.”</p>
                <p>“Ah, well I wouldn’t mind paying him a visit. It couldn’t hurt I suppose. Do you know how to get a hold of him?”</p>
                <p>Gemma responded.</p>
                <p>“I’ve got one of his old cards. He used to have a business, but his address and number on there are still good. Let me go get it.”</p>
                <p>Arthur rolled his eyes, then went into an arm stretch and yawned.</p>
                <p>“So, you think this Martin is just full of it?” Mark asked.</p>
                <p>“Like I said the guy has always been one to drink. He used to do a lot of deer hunting back in the day, and he didn’t do that sober either. The story goes he went into Ducamp’s once with a couple of the guys allowed to hunt in there. Martin disappeared. The hunters came out without him, couldn’t find him anywhere. Called friends down to help, even got a couple of police down there. Nobody could find Martin. Everyone knew he was a drinker, and figured he had either fallen asleep, or had stumbled out of the timber and wandered away. Well, he was gone over a day I think, and people were muttering that Ducamp’s had turned into the Lost 98 and claimed its own soul or whatever they say. Then Martin turns up, laying in one of the cornfields that runs next to the Ducamp timber. He was bloodied, his right leg had been broken but had a splint on it. He said he had fallen, broke it, and blacked out from the pain. When he woke up, he was being dragged out to the corn field.”</p>
                <p>“Dragged? Who was dragging him?”</p>
                <p>“He said it was an Indian.”</p>

                <h3 class="chapter" id="chapter-two">Chapter 2</h3>

                <p>Mark rolled up to the address Gemma had given him. He had tried calling a couple of times first, but no response, and no voice mail. The place was already a lot for Mark to take in. The land was flat all around, surrounded by plowed corn fields, but there were a few acres of grass and gravel. The property actually had two houses on it, one of them was in a horrible state of disrepair, the other looked livable, but not desirable. There was one giant shed with a combine and tractor, a two-car garage, and two smaller barns. Mark was hoping he was right in choosing the lesser of two evils and pulled up closer to the house that looked more hospitable. </p>
                <p>He grabbed his pocket-sized notebook and stuffed it in his jacket before climbing out of the car and stepping up to the front door. Based on what he had heard of Martin, he might be passed out. So Mark was aggressive with his knocks, in case he had to wake him up. He felt like this guy, drunk or not, had information for him, he certainly did not want to have to return to this place. </p>
                <p>Mark tried the doorbell, waited a minute, knocked and waited another minute. He tried the doorbell once more and thought about checking some windows to see if Martin was just passed out. That probably was a little too intrusive and possibly a good way to get shot.</p>
                <p>“Help you with something?” A voice sliced through the air and Mark was embarrassed by how much it made him jump. </p>
                <p>“Oh, uh, hello, yeah, thank you, I’m looking for Martin?” Mark was not successfully recovering any dignity in his clearly still startled state. The gentlemen in front of him looked harmless enough by his demeanor. He was wearing brown canvas like pants and a denim shirt covered in mud and grease. Clearly Mark had interrupted some type of laborious project.</p>
                <p>“Martin is out. He probably won’t be back until later tonight or might even be tomorrow.”</p>
                <p>“Okay, thank you. I can come back in the next couple of days and try to catch him.”</p>
                <p>“Well, if you’re heading through Clarinda, he is usually posted at a bar there. You could pop in and meet him.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>
                <p>“Yup.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, that’d be great. Can you point me in the right direction?”</p>
                <p>After some instructions and an awkward handshake, Mark nodded in appreciation and made a swift exit.</p>
                <p>It was still a little early for a drink, but Mark could do with some food if this place had anything to offer. Either way, he still thought it would be a good idea to catch Martin and ask him some questions. If nothing else he might be able to give him another lead.</p>
                <p>Mark backed out of the gravel driveway and headed down the road. The GPS on his phone was already leading him towards the bar. He wondered about Martin. What kind of guy might he find? Somebody who was known to drink heavily? Somebody who owned land but had other people working it while he spent a weekday in a bar? Somebody who had once disappeared for a day until rescued by an unknown forest dweller?</p>
                <p>The drive into town only took ten minutes and the directions led him right where he needed to go.  Mark parked and went inside without raising many eyebrows. Most of the people seemed too wrapped up in their current conversations. A couple of old timers at the bar were chatting in raised tones and belting laughter fit for giants.</p>
                <p>Mark filled an empty bar stool and was greeted quickly by the bartender.</p>
                <p>“Hey there, what can I get for ya?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, uh, just a light beer. I’m not picky. Is the kitchen open?”</p>
                <p>“Yup, special today is a pork tenderloin.”</p>
                <p>“You know what, the tenderloin will be great, and, uh, just fries would be fine for the side.” The bartender nodded and was about to turn to place Mark’s order but Mark caught her with another request.</p>
                <p>“Also, just curious, but I’m looking for a Martin Foreth. Do you know if he is here?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, ol’ Martin is back shooting pool in the corner. Want me to bring your beer and food back there?”</p>
                <p>“That would be great thanks.” The bartender smiled and nodded and went to put in his order. Mark spun off his stool and headed to the back. This end of the room had the typical barroom entertainment items, a pool table, juke box, and dart board. The pool table was being circled and played solo by an older gentleman, so Mark didn’t have to make a guess. He walked right up to Martin who, after a shot, sat back on a stool contemplating the table and sipping on a beer.</p>
                <p>“Martin, Martin Foreth?” Mark asked, and Martin perked up, confused but not hostile.</p>
                <p>“Hello I’m Mark Maeson.” Mark smiled and shook Martin’s hand, trying his best to seem friendly and to keep the mood light. Martin hadn’t lost the “deer in headlights” look yet.</p>
                <p>“Hey there. Something I can do for ya?”</p>
                <p>“I hope so. I’ve been kind of circling around this part of Iowa for a little while collecting stories and interviews for a book I’m working on. In the last couple of days your name has come up as somebody I should reach out to.”</p>
                <p>“Oh?” From the look on Martin’s face, he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, um, the Millsons and then Art and Gemma Folster.”</p>
                <p>“Ha! You talked to Art, huh? I bet he got a kick out of sending you to me. What’s this all about anyways?”</p>
                <p>“Well, that’s a…” The bartender came up with Mark’s beer which Mark grabbed and reached for his wallet. She shook her head at him. “Don’t worry about it, Hun. I’ll bring you a tab when you’re ready.”</p>
                <p>“Martin can I get you a refill?” Martin raised his glass and nodded in approval. Mark turned back to the bartender. “You can put his on my tab please.”</p>
                <p>“Sure thing, Hun.” She walked back to the bar and Martin nodded at Mark as well, in gratitude. </p>
                <p>“Thank you.” He took a sip of his own beer before starting back up.</p>
                <p>“I’ve been collecting stories. You know some true, some debatable. You could think of it like a collection of campfire tales. Then I try to find which ones have some pieces of truth to them. Seems like everyone is convinced there are some strange happenings with different wooded areas around here.”</p>
                <p>“Ducamp’s.” Martin’s eyes were wide and unmoving as they gazed a hole into the pool table in front of him. Mark sensed he wasn’t seeing the table though but some unknown visions in his own mind.</p>
                <p>“Yes, that was one of them. That and the Lost 98.”</p>
                <p>“Something is funny about the Lost 98 for sure. I’ve been in there a couple times as well and it’s the damnedest thing. It’s always cool in there, no matter what time of year. Something ain’t right about that land. If you talk to anyone else who has been in there, they will tell ya. Don’t take my word for it.”</p>
                <p>“What about Ducamp’s?”</p>
                <p>“Ain’t nothing special about Ducamp’s. It don’t have half the stories the Lost 98 does. God damn, ain’t two people gone missing around that timber?”</p>
                <p>“Well, I heard you dropped off the map yourself for a bit at Ducamp’s.” The bartender came back over with a new beer for Martin. He took a long drink, and then a deep breath. All that buildup for a one-word reply.</p>
                <p>“Yup.”</p>
                <p>Mark tried to soften things up a bit.</p>
                <p>“Listen, Martin, I’m not trying to pry or anything. I’m just here to chat, and anything you tell me I can keep anonymous if I use it in the book. I can even give you something in writing to bind me to it.”</p>
                <p>“Nah, I ain’t worried about all that. You play?” Martin nodded at the pool table.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, sure. I’ll rack them up.” Martin already had quarters stacked on the pool table. He shoved four into the payer and Mark fished the balls out and racked them up. Martin broke and spread the table well but didn’t sink a ball. Mark dropped a single stripe, and Martin was back up. Before he lined up his shot, he took another drink and deep breath.</p>
                <p>“I suppose somebody told you about my adventure at Ducamp’s then?”</p>
                <p>“Not much of a story. I just heard you had broken your leg, and nobody could find you. Then when you turned up you said you had some help.”</p>
                <p>“The Indian, you mean.”</p>
                <p>“Was it an Indian?”</p>
                <p>“I regret ever saying that. Somebody helped me and that I know for sure. Now I was tired, maybe a couple drinks in me, and I had a broken leg. It’s lucky I didn’t see Pocahontas dancing around them woods.” Mark allowed himself to chuckle and Martin smirked at this reaction.</p>
                <p>“For a while I would get shit daily for that story. Nowadays, people don’t bring it up much. And the truth is, I’m not sure anymore on the details. Did I dream some of them? Who knows? I woke up once in the woods and somebody was wrapping my leg, putting the splint on it. I wasn’t awake long though before I passed back out. I perked up a little bit when he was dragging me out into the open, but all in all, I was only half awake for a minute or so throughout the entire deal.”</p>
                <p>“So what made you think it was an Indian?”</p>
                <p>“Well, and here again I don’t know. Did I see what I saw? I don’t know. It was a man. He had longer hair tied back and tan skin. Either really old or homemade clothes. That’s what I remembered. It didn’t matter though, and the more people laughed it off the more I doubted the whole damn thing.”</p>
                <p>“I don’t think anyone has told me who exactly it was that found you that day.”</p>
                <p>“Well, eventually, I perked back up a bit. My phone had been long dead. I got to where I was sitting up against a tree, with my leg out in front me. A few cars went by that gravel road on the west side of the timber, and somebody saw me waving.”</p>
                <p>“Have you been back to Ducamp’s since?”</p>
                <p>“Nah, I haven’t even been hunting after that. I put on some weight after hurting my leg and I just don’t get around as well as I used to. Playing pool here is about the best exercise I get.” Martin returned his focus to the pool table, and Mark didn’t interrupt. Martin sank two solids and then missed.</p>
                <p>“You mentioned earlier you had been to the Lost 98? Was that for hunting as well?”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, a couple of times. That place is just eerie. There is definitely something up with it. I mean I don’t want to say haunted because some people might think I’m getting crazier. Not a lot of people who have been in there even once want to go again. It’s unsettling.”</p>
                <p>“What’s unsettling? You said it’s always chilly in there?”</p>
                <p>“I can’t explain it, but yeah. It’s enough to unnerve you a bit. Always quiet too. Which is normal in a lot of timbers once you get into the thick of them. But usually, even if you are a few acres into a timber, you can hear a gun shot or a combine going. Not in the 98 though. I feel like it just sucks up all the noise in the world. You going in there?”</p>
                <p>“I would like to eventually. I can’t figure out who owns it though. Everyone has a different answer for me.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, there used to be a guy named Max who owned it. That’s who had it those times I was down there. There is farmland attached to the property. The part the 98 sits on is just too hilly and rocky. It would take a lot of time and money to turn it into something usable. That’s why it got the name the Lost 98, because it’s basically a hundred wasted acres that can’t be farmed.”</p>
                <p>“That’s interesting.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, and I think there is a small cabin somewhere in there. I haven’t seen it just heard about it. Not sure who built it or when. I guess it’s tucked away in there somewhere. Tough to find unless you’re looking."</p>
                <p>Mark’s food had arrived. He thanked the bartender, and took a few shots on the table before digging in. Martin took over the table while Mark ate a few bites.</p>
                <p>“Do you have any idea who I could talk to about the Lost 98? Do you know who Max sold it to?”</p>
                <p>“I don’t. I haven’t talked to Max in a while. After he sold that land he moved out of the county.”</p>
                <p>“Do you know how I could reach him?”</p>
                <p>“Sorry, I don’t. I’ve got a card though for Keith Williams. He hunted them woods years back. Him and a buddy of his. Let me get it out.” Martin fished the card out of is overstuffed wallet and handed it over.</p>
                <p>Mark thanked him and looked it over while digging back into his food. He was hungrier than he thought. While he was eating, someone strolled up to Martin and smacked a hand behind his shoulder blades in a friendly fashion.</p>
                <p>“Hey there, Martin. How’s the shooting?” The man seemed friendly. He had a commanding voice and a big smile turned up under his thick glasses. His white hair was combed over nice and neat on his head. His apparel was common from what Mark had seen around town. Blue jeans over cowboy boots, big belt buckle, and a tucked in plaid shirt.</p>
                <p>“Oh, hey, Lee. Yeah, just shooting some with my new buddy here. This is Mark.” Mark stepped up and shook hands with Lee. One handshake could tell Mark a lot. It was something else he had grown accustomed to on his recent travels. People who worked a lifetime with their hands and built their strength not from weights but from working with tools. Their hands often dwarfed Mark’s and had dry skin from lots of washing and scrubbing. Sometimes still showing traces of grease or blood.</p>
                <p>“Nice to meet ya, Mark. Martin here playing fair?” He chuckled and gave a nod at Martin who chose not to acknowledge this attack on his character.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, of course.” Mark replied.</p>
                <p>“Mark here is working on a book. Said he has been collecting stories,” Martin mentioned to Lee.</p>
                <p>“Oh yeah? What kind of stories?” Lee looked over at Mark with interest.</p>
                <p>“Any kind honestly. Many of them tend to be tall tales and what not. I told Martin it was kind of a collection of campfire stories, but some of them I try to trace back to their beginning. Looking for any signs of truth.”</p>
                <p>“Well, I’m sure you’re not finding any shortage of that type of stuff around here.” Lee kind of glanced at Martin. Seemed like Lee could probably guess now why Mark was meeting with him. Martin was just sipping his beer and looking at the table. Mark could tell he didn’t really seem interested in being the focus of attention anymore.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, so what do you have for me, Lee? Any urban legends you share when you’ve got an out-of-towner around?”</p>
                <p>“Haha, well I don’t know about urban legends. You know this is Iowa. We don’t have a Sasquatch or anything fun like that around. Every town has a haunted house, though, I’m sure of that.”</p>
                <p>“So where is the nearest one around here? Or is it just the woods around here that are haunted?”</p>
                <p>Lee chuckled again. “Well, I don’t know that anything around here is haunted. You know we’ve got a lot of deer, mushroom, and antler hunters around with lots of big timbers for them to comb through. I think people just get in those places and spook easily, or they come up with stuff on their own. You know what I mean?”</p>
                <p>“Definitely. I would agree with you. I think a lot of things we perceive are tricks we’ve played on ourselves.” Mark replied and Lee nodded in agreement.</p>
                <p>“Lee, can I get you a drink?” Mark asked.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, sure, um, whiskey and coke would do great.”</p>
                <p>A minute later Mark was back with the drink. He excused himself to the bathroom while Martin and Lee caught up for a few minutes. When he came back and sat down, he was looking at his phone, so Lee tapped him on the shoulder to grab his attention.</p>
                <p>“Hey, Mark, you know I was chatting here with Martin and he jogged my memory on something. I don’t know if it would interest you, it might not.”</p>
                <p>“What do you have?” Mark leaned in. Lee took a sip before starting.</p>
                <p>“Well, my brother-in-law and his boy used to come up here deer hunting every winter. They live up in Council Bluffs and would take the same route all the time coming through Red Oak and then Highway 34 going East. Well, they are on their way here for a weekend hunting trip and driving at night. They turned on a road which goes up a hill so you’ve got a good view of the sky. Well, as they are driving, they start to notice lights, like plane lights, but these are moving fast. Not like when you watch a big airliner in the sky and it just kind of slowly passes along. These were moving all around and quick, like fighter jets, or something else. Then, out of nowhere, they see a big explosion in the sky. Just one big fireball. That was it. Followed by some more quick lights. But they just kept driving and, eventually, everything just faded away. Of course they arrived at our house and told us all about it. We hadn’t seen or heard anything but at some point that weekend before they left there was a news story about the explosion and it being some kind of weather balloon test.”</p>
                <p>“Really? There was something like that in the news about it?” This intrigued Mark. Something being mentioned publicly meant this could be more than just some drivers with tired eyes seeing weird lights in the dark.</p>
                <p>“Yeah, and in the paper, too, if I remember.” Lee sounded sincere. He was telling the story as if it were fact and not waiting for any kind of reaction. Martin excused himself and headed to the bathroom.</p>
                <p>“Do you remember when this happened?” Mark asked.</p>
                <p>“Well, shit. I mean I couldn’t give you an exact date. It would have been about twenty years ago.”</p>
                <p>“That gives me a starting point at least.”</p>
                <p>“Oh, and I guess it had to be early December. They only ever came down to hunt within the first couple weeks of December.”</p>
                <p>“That definitely helps narrow it down too.” Mark raised his glass in a cheers motion to Lee. “See? You had a story for me all along. You were holding out.”</p>
                <p>Lee let out a laugh. “Well I don’t know what you can do with that but glad to share.”</p>
                <p>Martin rejoined them and the subject morphed into things like sports and the weather while Lee and Mark played a couple more games of pool. Mark paid for his food and bought the guys another round before he left. Mark wasn’t sure what his next step was. He wasn’t getting far on finding owners for either of the storied sights he came down here for. Short of just trespassing and checking out the areas for himself he was really low on options.</p>
                <p>Back at his hotel in Clarinda, Mark was trying his best to unwind. Shoes off and sprawled out on his bed, he clicked through the channels trying to find a familiar movie or show to fall asleep to. His phone buzzed on the nightstand. He rolled over and saw he had an email.</p>
                <p>
                    <i>Hey Mark,</i>
